TeleMoMa is a teleoperation toolkit that enables intuitive teleoperation of high-DoF mobile manipulators. We provide a common pipeline that supports several teleoperation interfaces such as vision, VR, mobile phones and more, and enables mixing-and-matching between them. While we provide code for several mobile manipulators in sim and real, the versatility of TeleMoMa allows easy plug-and-play teleoperation of any mobile manipulator in general. 

## Setup  
### System Requirements
- Ubuntu 20.04
- Python 3.9+

Other system configurations may work, but we haven’t tested them extensively and may only be able to provide limited support.

Note: TeleMoMa can work with higher versions of python but if iGibson sim environment is required then please use python3.9.

### Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/UT-Austin-RobIn/telemoma.git
cd telemoma
conda create --name telemoma python==3.9
conda activate telemoma
pip install -e .
```

### Install iGibson (Optional)
We provide a demo script to test different teleoperation modes in the iGibson sim environment. iGibson can be installed by running,
```
(telemoma) > pip install igibson
```
In case of installation or runtime issues with iGibson, please checkout their exhaustive [documentation](https://stanfordvl.github.io/iGibson/) and [github](https://github.com/StanfordVL/iGibson).

## Usage

### Quickstart

To verify your installation the following code can be used to run TeleMoMa in a sandbox environment in iGibson.
```
(telemoma) > python telemoma/demo_igibson.py --robot tiago --teleop_config telemoma/configs/only_keyboard.py 
```

```--teleop_config``` defines the input modality to be used for controlling each part of the robot. Some example configurations are provided in [telemoma/configs](telemoma/configs/) folder.

Make sure the input hardware is correctly setup by following the instructions provided in [Human Interface](telemoma/human_interface/README.md).

### Human Interface
Hardware specific setup instructions for devices compatible with TeleMoMa are provided [here](telemoma/human_interface/README.md).

### Robot Interface
The details on the sim environment installations, real robot codebase and instructions on setting up TeleMoMa on your own robot are provided [here](telemoma/robot_interface/README.md).
